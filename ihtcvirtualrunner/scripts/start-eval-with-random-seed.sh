# This script can be used to execute our GIPS-based solution for
# the IHTC 2024 for all instances given.
# It uses exactly one random seed as parameter and creates output
# folders accordingly.
#
# It assumes that in the current directory there is a folder called
# `ihtc2024_competition_instances` containing all instance files.
#
# Example: `./start-eval-with-random-seed.sh 42`
#           (one argument = random seed is neccessary)
#
# If you have any questions, feel free to write us an email.
